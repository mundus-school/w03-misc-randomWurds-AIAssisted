# Small self-study project for webdev class
Note that ChatGPT was used in the making of this project to understand the random positioning of the elements. I take no credit whatsoever for the creation of this app. (As if that would ever matter with this hillariously pointless thing).

## Languages:
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Description:
A small app which periodically fills the browser window with words related to webdevelopment. Taking the concept of "pointless" to a whole different level. Why did I make this? I do not know. Mundus works in mysterious ways...

## How to run:
Download files and run index.html in browser
